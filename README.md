Budyko-Sellers type Energy Balance Model (EBM) (Budyko, 1969; Sellers, 1969).

Numerical integration of the model, the main characteristics of the steady state, and the transient solution (radiative imbalance) 

The procedure consists on the selection of different albedo schemes, modifications of the radiative solar energy input, and some sensitivity analysis to evaluate impacts on the EBM solutions

Forward time discretization scheme for the numerical integration of the model. 

For the radiative equilibrium surface (spin-up), the meridional temperature profile from the model's stationary non-diffusive solution is the initial condition.

To reach a stable equilibrium surface, an iteration of 50 years with a timestep of one day has been made.

We used two different temperature-dependent albedo schemes. These two simple schemes are the so called ice and snow-ice albedo. Both schemes include the positive feedback of the growth of ice in the model
